            Console.WriteLine("The character sequence: rin of this string, starts from " + demo_string.IndexOf("rin")); //This method finds out where from a character or a sequence of characters present within a string starts from. In case we use this method when a character or a set of characters is not present in the string, we should get the index as -1.        
            Console.WriteLine("The sequence of characters you wanted to chunk out from your original string i.e String, suppose from the index 2: " + demo_string.Substring(2)); //This method chunks out a character or a set of charaters from a specified index. We can also pass how many characters we want to chunk out, like this: demo_string.Substring(2, 3), specifying to chunk out 3 characters from the index 2.

            Console.WriteLine("The absolute value of -4, represented as |4|: " + Math.Abs(-4)); //Finds out the absolute value of a number.
            Console.WriteLine("3 to the power 2: " + Math.Pow(3, 2)); //Computes the power.
            Console.WriteLine("The maximum of 2 and 2.2: " + Math.Max(2, 2.2)); //Returns which number is maximum. At most two numbers can be provided. To determine which number is minimum there is Math.Min() function.
            Console.WriteLine("The round figure of 5.6: " + Math.Round(5.6)); //Rounds a number.
